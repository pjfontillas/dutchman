# The delivery person challenge

Right now, if you click the `Order Shrimp` button on the Frying Dutchman
site, a JSON message gets placed on the `orders` queue, but there is
nothing to consume that message and deliver the shrimp to the stockroom.  
For this challenge, implement the delivery person.  This is a program that will:

* Upon startup, update our delivery person, Pat, in the `employee` table to 
have a status of `working`
* Consume messages from the `orders` queue
* Create a record in the `stockroom_item` table in the SQLite database with the 
name of the item and count delivered from the order
* Simulate a 20 second delay for processing each order
* Upon shutdown, update working employees back to idle

Write this program in the `delivery_person` directory in any language and with
any tools that you want (feel free to add anything that you want to the
`provisioning.sh` file to make it available in the Vagrant VM).  The only
requirement is that the program can be started in the Vagrant VM by running
`make start` in the `delivery_person` directory.

When this challenge is complete, you should see orders moving out of the queue 
and shrimp showing up in your stockroom on the The Frying Dutchman web page.  You 
can now click the `Refill Buffet` button to move items from the stockroom onto 
the buffet so they can get into Homer's mouth.  You can check out the Homer program to 
see if he is indeed eating.
